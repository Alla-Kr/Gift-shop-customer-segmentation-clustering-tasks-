**Main goals of the project:**
1. Pre-process the data set.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis and identify key patterns.
3. Create product and customer categories.
4. Build several machine learning models that solve the client clustering problem, determine the number of clusters and interpret them.
5. Design a process for predicting a client's interest category and test your model on new clients.
